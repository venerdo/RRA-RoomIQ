# API Contract Files

This folder stores backend API contract definitions and sample request payloads for Postman import and manual verification.

## Files

- `rra-roomiq-stage1-contract.json` — shared foundation/API contract, accepted Stage 2 through Stage 5 progress, verified S6-01 through S6-14 progress, protected Booking workflows, and the S6-11 public share-card contract
- `rra-roomiq-identity-postman-collection.json` — importable Postman collection with safe sample payloads, variables, and the authenticated identity flows for users, roles, permissions, privileges, and auth endpoints
- `rra-roomiq-room-postman-collection.json` — importable Room collection with all 31 documented Room operations, bearer-token inheritance, correlation IDs, safe variables, and representative requests
- `validate-room-postman-collection.mjs` — route inventory, variable, bearer, correlation, multipart upload, and secret-marker validator for the Room collection
- `../scheduling-service/README.md` — Scheduling persistence ownership, PostgreSQL migration, runtime configuration, and verification notes

## Import into Postman

1. Open Postman.
2. Click Import.
3. Choose either JSON file in this folder. Use the Postman collection for interactive API execution and the stage contract for reference metadata.
4. Use the included variables and safe sample payloads to validate the current backend foundation.

## Automated collection validation

From the `backend/` directory, run:

```bash
node api-contracts/validate-identity-postman-collection.mjs
node api-contracts/validate-room-postman-collection.mjs
```

The Identity validator checks Postman v2.1 metadata, implemented Identity/support endpoints, required variables, bearer/correlation headers, token/resource capture scripts, reserved sample domains, and forbidden secret markers. The Room validator checks all 31 documented Room method/path pairs, required variables, bearer/correlation configuration, multipart photo upload shape, and secret markers.

## Current contract status

Stage 6 was accepted by the user on 2026-10-12 after all S6-01 through S6-14 verification passed. The Stage 7 checklist has been approved; requirement implementation has not started; no Notification business APIs or persistence have been added. The contract records 38 Organization and 31 Room operations, Scheduling's owned persistence and API surfaces, bounded RRULE evaluation, constraint validation, fail-closed availability occupancy integration, protected Booking request, decision, direct-booking, reservation lifecycle, meeting, participant, cancellation, extension, share-link management, and the internal occupancy snapshot operation. All protected Booking operations require bearer authentication and current Identity authorization; owner-service calls propagate the caller token, and no Booking route is configured on the API Gateway. Only `GET /api/v1/public/meetings/{token}` is unauthenticated, and it returns the explicit public-card allowlist. Approval, direct booking, recurring occupancy, visibility, cancellation, extension, and event delivery behavior are specified in `rra-roomiq-stage1-contract.json`. The user-approved Flyway V7 `booking_event_outbox` schema persists occupancy events transactionally; delivery is at-least-once with stable event-ID deduplication, publisher confirms, mandatory-return detection, and durable retries.

S6-12 serializes request/direct-booking, extension, and share-link creation retries with PostgreSQL transaction-scoped advisory locks while preserving unique database constraints. Equivalent retries return existing results; key reuse with different payloads returns explicit conflicts. Cancellation replays require the same currently authorized actor and equivalent payload. Share-link creation requires `Idempotency-Key`; versioned HMAC-derived tokens replay deterministically while only their hashes are stored. The approved S6-12 ERD addition is nullable `MEETING_SHARE_LINK.idempotency_key VARCHAR(128)` with `UNIQUE(created_by_user_id, idempotency_key)`, implemented by Flyway V6. The S6-14 gate passed: Booking 138/138 including PostgreSQL overlap/concurrency tests, Identity 53/53, common-web 6/6, and all 311 tests across the full 11-module reactor; all had zero failures, errors, or skips.

S6-10 adds protected extension request, decision, and requester-cancellation operations without Gateway routes or ERD changes. Current Identity authorization derives requester and decision actor; self-decision is denied. Approval revalidates Scheduling constraints, current Room policy and maintenance, the release buffer, and Booking occupancy, then transactionally extends both the reservation and occurrence under the existing lock and PostgreSQL exclusion barriers. Recurring reservations are explicitly unsupported for extension. Focused S6-10 Booking tests passed 52/52, Identity passed 53/53, common-web passed 6/6, and the full 11-module reactor passed 282/282, with zero failures, errors, or skips.

Recurring Booking acceptance uses the stored Scheduling RRULE and timezone; Scheduling's existing one-year/365-occurrence bound remains authoritative. Booking verifies returned calendar/rule/timezone metadata, checks each occurrence against Scheduling, effective Room policy, Room's existing protected maintenance API, and Booking occupancy, then atomically stores the existing series reservation, one occurrence row per date, and the meeting data. A request-level room rule is not a substitute for per-date checks: if any effective rule requires approval, the full series is held for the existing approval workflow, and the maximum effective release buffer is applied to all occurrence intervals. Scheduling and maintenance conflicts return occurrence-scoped stable errors before writes; Booking occupancy conflicts use the shared `ROOM_OCCUPANCY_CONFLICT` error with affected dates in its message and roll back the transaction. PostgreSQL exclusion conflicts/deadlocks normalize to the same response. No new Booking route or ERD change was made, and no route was added to the API Gateway.

Identity returns requester display data only on an authorized APPROVE decision and validates lifecycle and meeting actors against current Identity permissions and organizational scope. Stale, repeated, and conflicting decisions fail with stable shared error envelopes. S6-07 adds protected check-in and completion routes; check-in is `CONFIRMED → IN_PROGRESS` and completion is `IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED`. Actor identity and timestamps are server-derived. The user approved nullable `reservation.completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, required iff the status is `COMPLETED`; Flyway V3 and the ERD document the constraint. S6-08 adds protected meeting and participant routes, with no public/share-link behavior and no Gateway routes. Internal participants are validated against active Identity accounts and external participants are allowed only when the persisted request's `externalGuests` flag was validated under Room policy. The existing half-open buffered reservation/occurrence intervals and PostgreSQL GiST exclusion constraints remain the occupancy barriers. No automatic overdue/missed-check-in transition is implemented. S6-08 verification passed: focused Booking meeting/client/interceptor selection 26/26, route/schema context 7/7, Identity 52/52, common-web 6/6, and full 11-project reactor 261/261, all with zero failures/errors/skips. Tests cover scope/visibility decisions, active status, trusted display names, request spoofing, external guest policy, and denial before participant details are loaded. The user selected all-or-nothing recurring-series acceptance; whole-series validation must not leave partial bookings.
